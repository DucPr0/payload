Payload - The gamemode from Team Fortress 2!
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/payload-the-gamemode-from-tf2.67139/

This plugin aims to recreate the payload gamemode from TF2 by adding lobbies, proximity minecart pushing, checkpoints, custom classes with configurable health and spawning items, also with a GUI for admins. Spawning items can also be configured to execute commands, so that integration with other plugins such as CrackShot are possible.

Further details on how to use the plugin is detailed in the SpigotMC page.
