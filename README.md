# payload

Payload - The gamemode from Team Fortress 2!
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/payload-the-gamemode-from-tf2.67139/

This plugin aims to recreate the payload gamemode from TF2 by adding lobbies, proximity minecart pushing, checkpoints, custom classes and more!

Features:
- Class creator: Create any custom classes with custom health, custom items on spawn, custom effects and more!
- Checkpoints: Attackers get a customizable reward upon capturing a checkpoint with the bomb.
- Humiliation round: A feature from the original game. When a winning team is decided, the winners receive a speed boost and the ability to insta-kill the other team, while the losers are stripped of their weapons and have their speed decreased.
- Team chat: Teams can discuss strategies in private!
- Customizable respawn times, so that attackers and defenders' respawn times can be customized appropriately based on the map.

Planned:
- Blockages that are removed or spawned based on each captured checkpoints.
- Moving spawns for attackers and defenders based on each captured checkpoints.
- Changing respawn times for attackers and defenders based on each captured checkpoints.
- Fix the minecart's orientation being slightly bugged upon going up a slope.

Further details on how to use the plugin is detailed in the SpigotMC page.
